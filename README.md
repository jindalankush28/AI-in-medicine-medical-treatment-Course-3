AI FOR MEDICINE SPECIALIZATION 
COURSE 1 - AI for Medical Diagnosis | Stanford University through Coursera

	classified diseases on chest x-rays using a CNNs.

	Implemented standard evaluation metrics to see how well a model performs in diagnosing diseases

	Applied a pre-trained U-net model to segment tumour regions in 3-D brain MRI images

COURSE 2 - AI for Medical Prognosis | Stanford University through Coursera

	Built a linear model and evaluated the model by calculating concordance index

	Used random forest model to predict the risk of disease

	Implemented survival models

	Designed a risk model using linear and tree-based models

COURSE 3 - AI for Medical Treatment | Stanford University through Coursera

	Analysed data from randomised controlled trial and interpreted ML models for treatment effect estimation

	Extracted disease labels from clinical reports and performed medical question answering using BERT
